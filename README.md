# Social-Influence-Maximisation

The project aims to predict and maximize social media influence. The model based approach involves training the neural network using simulations to predict active node set from a given seed set. The simulations are produced using propagation models as discussed in further sections. Further LSTM based sequence to sequence models that are based on the encoder decoder architecture can be used to predict the sequence depicting the spread and extracting useful information about the network structure which is unknown. The aim of the project is to analyse social networks whose structure is not explicitly known. In case of most of the real life networks like twitter network we don't know the structure of the graph. For example we know that a tweet has been re-tweeted but we don't know the order in which the re-tweets occurred as we don't have any information regarding the spread. Being able to analyse the next active node not only provides us some useful information about the graph, but it also allows us to predict the future influence and impact of the spread.
